Although PD1 blockade has been transformative in the treat ment of patients with NSCLC AR is common and understanding of the molecular mechanisms of resistance remains quite limited Before embarking on this report we had hypothesized that noninamed or cold tumors characterized by exclusionary immunologic barriers or an absence of T cell inltration would signicantly contribute to resistance 3Previously neoan tigen loss and tumormediated immunosuppression have beenassociated with primary resistance to immunotherapy 54243In contrast we found that neoantigen depletion", "55": "does not appear to be a dominant mediator of AR In fact most tumors have re tained or increased inammatory characteristics rather thanimmune excluded or desert phenotype with signicant upregu lation of IFN gsuggestive of persistent but evidently insufcient antitumor immune response The persistent if incompleteantitumor immune response may also manifest in the clinical observation that some patients who develop AR can still have durable survival for many years following initial emergence ofresistance In addition to associations with chronic upregulationof the IFN gresponse pathway we also observed strong upre gulation of oxidative phosphorylation and DNA repair pathway genes which are consistent with a recent report 44which pro poses acquisition of a hypermetabolic state with high expres sion of glycolytic and oxidative phosphorylation pathway genes as a potential escape", "56": "mechanism in ICBresistant melanoma cells The inammatory phenotypes we identify have implications for future rational development of new immunotherapy strategies forpatients with AR Most notably immune recruitment and inltra tion did not appear to be the primary biologic challenges which provide credence to strategies aimed to reprogram and rescuenative antitumor immunity Delivery of de novo antitumor im munity via engineered antigenspecic cellular or T cell recep torbased therapies 4549also appears wellsuited to exploit the lack of barriers to immune trafcking and persistent tumor antigen expression Supporting this hypothesis we have reported notable responses among patients in this population 4650We are also exploring strategies to interrupt persistent IFN gsignaling to reinvigorate immune function and immune check point inhibitor activity in tumors resistant to ICB51While we did observe a

clinical cohort is that it relies on bulk exome and transcriptome data which are prone to beaffected by tumor purity Due to constraints associated withsample purity we were unable to accurately analyze copy num ber or loss of heterozygosity Furthermore IFN ggroupings were only possible for patients with paired pre and postprogression samples because they were determined relative to each individual Interestingly recent analyses utilizing single cell multiomics have demonstrated enrichment of CD8 T cell exhaustion in the setting of AR to PD1 blockade in sam ples from two patients similar to the exhausted CD8T cells we found in our lung cancer mouse model52Future efforts", "58": "incorporating single cell multiomics will be important to parsecancer cellintrinsic vs immune or stromally related mecha nisms of resistance Our analysis is limited to correlational ob servations and focused on PD1 immunotherapy and not onPD1 and chemotherapy combination Although this is now a routine treatment regimen it is complicated by the uncertainty of contributions of components both to response and to resistance so for the moment we have excluded analyses of sam ples from these patients 53Further heterogeneity in the dura tion and depth of response to PD1 blockade in the clinicalcohort could not be explored deeper in our molecular cohort due to small sample sizes Future work is needed to both address heterogeneity in response to monotherapy with ICBas well as resistance to combinations of chemotherapy andimmunotherapy", "59": "regimens Our work informs and builds upon the prior preclinical and translational data supporting the intricate role of IFN gin sensi tivity and resistance to immunotherapy Whereas initial IFN g exposure may be fundamental to T cell activation

IFN g insensitivity to mutations in the JAKSTAT pathway we did notidentify specic defects in the IFN gsignaling pathway to explain the dysfunctional nature of IFN gresponse observed in a subset of patient samples While we found some evidence of B2M and other AP alterations these changes were predominantly subclonal and generally cooccurred in tumors with upregulation of IFN gpotentially suggesting they may", "60": "be an evolutionary consequence rather than an initiating cause of resistance Wehave previously shown that chronic IFN gsignaling may trigger a cascade of epigenetic

resistance presented here we recapitulate how acquired resistance is associated withupregulated cancerintrinsic IFN gresponse and ultimately tumor insensitivity to effective antitumor immunity Separately we also show that pretreatment exposure with IFN gin vitro leads to resistance in vivo to ICB treatment Furthermore we prelimi narily observe that in vivo generated acquired resistant cell

the 5 and 3 ends of the transcripts we used high throughput cap analysis of gene expression CAGE data from the FAN TOM consortium30 and polyAseq data from multiple studies31 37 respectively For the 5

of each merged cluster to find the maximum peak The TSS was then recalculated to be the 5most peak in the merged cluster with a signal of at least 50 of the maximum peak This criterion is referred to as the longest strong rule The goal of the reprocessing is to deter mine a frequently used TSS that is representative of the overall data rather than that with the absolute maximum tag counts In this

transcripts or those within 500 nucleo tides of the first nucleotide Alternatively we updated them manually when the genes required additional review We followed a similar logic for the 3 end and

and 70s when researchers began looking at the physiology of yogis and prac titioners of Transcendental meditation TM and mindfulness meditations in more detail Yoga is wide variety of religious and

to the variability in meditation practices and experimental designs Studies of this era showed that experienced meditators had different neurophysiology as compared to non meditators with early

the increased appearance of alpha and theta rhythms when awake although the interpre tation of this cortical slowing differed between studies 2 11 15 Specifically some authors mischaracterized that

assigned to receive the new vaccine or a placebo 1 These trials have become increasingly large and costly 2 and have stringent criteria for success This can lead to delays in introducing potentially lifesaving vaccines or even forestall the development of promising vaccines that fail to meet strict guidelines for approval An example of this comes from a maternal vaccine against respiratory

outcome of medically significant RSV efficacy of", "398": "394 with a 9752 confidence interval CI that ranged from 10 to 637 However examining several of the secondary clinical outcomes there was clear evidence of a beneficial effect against RSV hospitalizations Nevertheless because the CI for the primary outcome included zero the trial was deemed a failure and licensure of the vaccine and further testing were not pursued To be licensed this vaccine would likely need to again undergo testing in a large phase 3 clinical trial Even if a vaccine is successfully licensed based on data from a phase 3 randomized trial there is often a requirement from regulators that manufacturers monitor safety and effectiveness in realworld studies 5 In such studies the goal is to estimate the effect s

analyses that do not incorporate knowledge obtained from prior trials or evaluations In the case of a failed phase 3 trial in which there is evidence of a beneficial but not statistically significant effect of vaccination one possibility to speed licensure of the vaccine would be to incorporate data from the initial trial into the analysis of data from a new sm aller trial 67 This could be

that are different from those evaluated in the trial eg rare but severe outcomes like intensive care unit admission or deat h or risk groups for which it was not possible to obtain robust estimates in

duration of meditation appears to provide a more consistent boost in performance however the short 5minute meditation often provided a similar but slightly lower improvement and likely a similar physiological response Interestingly the 5minute control activity was also shown to have a performance boost The act of meditation consisted of closing eyes in a controlled position Meditation is also a time of sitting quietly being removed from stress of academic activities and not focusing on learning or other activities These same things took place during the control activity and we would even argue that this time of relaxation and sitting quietly is similar to meditation in several aspects and perhaps allows the brain to reset", "656": "to better perform in subsequent tasks perhaps also similar to socalled power naps of 510 minutes duration that may or may not involve any actual sleep When discussing these data and your findings with your students this can lead to discussions of the mechanism of action of meditation which we and many others believe is increasing the neuronal coordination and inducing slower firing of the neurons 3537 This in turn leads to the performance enhancing effect reviewed in 38 Studies of longer durations of meditation with subsequent EEG recordings show that meditation can reduce attentional blink and allows for more effective brain resource allocations 39 Other EEG studies have also shown that after meditation practice meditation can have an immediate effect on attentional measures 40 Limitations This study", "657": "only analyzes the effect of 5 minutes of meditation on a single performance measure psychomotor vigilance Other performance measures have been found to benefit from longer meditation but its unknown if 5 minutes of meditation would change performance on these other measures Longerterm meditation has been shown to improve information processing memory and other measures of attention reviewed in 3827 and these require follow up studies Our data show no impact of selfreported sleep duration on reaction time Due to the exploratory nature of our data this was not unexpected Normal sleep may show no effect due to meditation A previous study completed by our lab 32 showed that after a full night of sleep deprivation there was a larger boost in reaction time performance by meditation due", "658": "to the slower reaction time preintervention for these sleep deprived subjects Another study of attention and meditation after one night of sleep loss showed that those subjects that meditated had better attentional performance than those who rested 34 Both studies show the impact of an entire night sleep loss on attention that is then improved by meditation This finding may be limited to severe sleep deprivation and was unable to be seen in the sleep amounts reported by students which cover a more modest level of sleep debt Our 2minute PVT may also not be sensitive enough to capture sleep loss induced attentional deficits as both previous studies used the more widely accepted and validated 10minute PVT 3234 This topic of sleep and meditation should undergo further study", "659": "because

similar inci dence over time after accounting for vaccineinduced declines Fourth the estimates of recording ratios rely on the validity of estimates of the incidence of RSVattribut able hospitalizations Since there is no gold standard for estimates of RSVattributable hospitalizations it is hard to validate our findings Still our agebased estimates of recording ratios are similar to those from a previous study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 17", "834": "Lastly we used individuallevel hospital discharge data from 20052014 as state inpatient data sets normally lag several years We stopped the analysis in 2014 because this was the year when coding shifted from ICD9 to ICD10 However CDC sentinel surveil lance suggests that RSV rates were stable over time before the COVID19 pandemic 36 Therefore using more uptodate data is unlikely to change our estimates In conclusion children in families residing in lowSES areas had the highest incidence of RSVassociated hos pitalizations for respiratory illnesses The incidence of hospitalizations for RSV infections among older adults is greatly underrecorded More comprehensive testing for RSV among older adults might help to better define the disease burden Vaccines against RSV might provide sub stantial benefit to young children and older adultsAbbreviations", "835": "RSV Respiratory syncytial

susceptibility to subsequent infections By adding waning immunity we as sumed that individuals can become susceptible to infection af ter a long period of low virus exposure Several factors could

underestimation of hospitalization rates Fourth our model was not calibrated to the observed hospital ization data in the Netherlands due to the short observational period Instead we simulated RSV

based on IgG concentrations this is the primary basis of comparison between new and existing PCVs until vaccine effectiveness VE studies are performed typically several years after the introduction of

for the development of cancerspecific cytotoxic agents This paradigm has not been exploited in the past because there were no robust methods for systematically identifying synthetic lethal genes This is changing as a result of the increased availability of chemical and genetic tools for perturbing gene function in somatic cells The bottleneck to the development of safe and effective anticancer drugs does not lie in an inability to identify chemicals that will kill cancer cells In fact thousands of compounds have been identified over the past 50 years that will accomplish this feat Instead the bottle neck lies in our inability to identify chemicals that will kill cancer cells at concentrations that do not harm patients Most of", "1323": "the chemotherapeutic agents used today have

effect of the drug to changes in the activity of its intended target ontarget and the propensity of the drug to affect unintended targets offtargets at higher doses Offtarget effects can cause toxicity and in some cases antagonize ontarget biological effects Most anticancer drugs in use today were dis covered based on their ability to kill rapidly dividing cancer cells in vitro Predictably when administered to patients many of these drugs also injure rapidly divid ing normal cells such as bonemarrow haematopoietic precursors and gastrointestinal mucosal epithelial cells In addition many

These other forms of organ damage become particu larly important doselimiting in settings in which toxicity to rapidly dividing cells can be partially amel iorated through supportivecare measures such as bonemarrow transplantation For these reasons it is imperative that anticancer drugs be developed that can kill cancer cells at clinically achievable concentrations with therapeutic indices that are higher than those of classic cytotoxic agents Therapeutic index Many factors influence the therapeutic index of a drug Some relate to the quality of the drug itself for exam ple its ability to
