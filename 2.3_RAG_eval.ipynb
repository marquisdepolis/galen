      "Question 1: Define synthetic lethality\n",
      "Response is: Synthetic lethality refers to a genetic phenomenon where the simultaneous mutation of two genes leads to cell death, while mutation of either gene alone is compatible with cell viability. In other words, the combination of mutations in both genes is lethal, but each individual mutation is not. This concept has been observed in various organisms, including humans, and has implications in cancer research and therapy. It suggests that targeting the products of genes that are synthetic lethal to cancer-causing mutations could selectively kill cancer cells while sparing normal cells.\n",
      "Question 2: Synthetic lethality was discovered in which model organism?\n",
      "Response is: Synthetic lethality was discovered in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster.\n",
      "Question 3: PARP gene expression shows synthetic lethal relationship with mutations in which genes?\n",
      "Response is: The context information does not provide specific information about which genes PARP gene expression shows a synthetic lethal relationship with mutations.\n",
      "Question 4: Synthetic lethality mechanims for BRAF gene can be harnessed in combination with which gene?\n",
      "Response is: PARP inhibitors can be harnessed in combination with the BRAF gene.\n",
      "Question 5: Names of tumor suppressor proteins\n",
      "Response is: pRB, p53, p73\n",
      "Question 6: Define synthetic lethality\n",
      "Response is: Synthetic lethality refers to a genetic phenomenon where the simultaneous mutation of two genes leads to cell death, while mutation of either gene alone is compatible with cell viability. In other words, the combination of mutations in both genes is lethal, but each individual mutation is not. This concept has been observed in various organisms, including humans, and has implications in cancer research and therapy. By identifying genes that are synthetic lethal to cancer-causing mutations, researchers can potentially develop targeted therapies that selectively kill cancer cells while sparing normal cells.\n",
      "Question 7: Which model organisms was synthetic lethality first observed in?\n",
      "Response is: Synthetic lethality was first observed in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster.\n",
      "Question 8: Which drugs target ERBB2 in breast cancer?\n",
      "Response is: Pertuzumab and trastuzumab are drugs that target ERBB2 in breast cancer.\n",
      "Question 9: KRAS oncogene is mutated in which cancers?\n",
      "Response is: KRAS oncogene is mutated in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and colorectal cancer.\n",
      "Question 10: Which compounds are selectively lethal to MSH2 deficient cells?\n",
      "Response is: Methotrexate is one of the compounds that are selectively lethal to MSH2 deficient cells.\n",
      "Question 11: Which genes are targeted by Imatinib?\n",
      "Response is: Imatinib targets the kit receptor tyrosine kinase.\n",
      "Question 12: Which drugs target BRAF mutations?\n",
      "Response is: Dabrafenib, encorafenib, vemurafenib, and trametinib are drugs that target BRAF mutations.\n",
      "Question 13: Deletion of which gene leads to synthetic lethal inhibition of PRMT5?\n",
      "Response is: MTAP\n",
      "Question 14: Which gene is synthetic lethal partner of ARID1A?\n",
      "Response is: The synthetic lethal partner of ARID1A is not mentioned in the given context information.\n",
      "Question 15: What is Project Achilles?\n",
      "Response is: Project Achilles is a functional genomic screening initiative led by the Broad Institute. Its goal is to create a genome-wide catalogue of tumor vulnerabilities associated with genetic and epigenetic alterations. The project utilizes short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screening and CRISPR-based screening to interrogate gene essentiality in cancer cell lines. The data obtained from Project Achilles are valuable for understanding cancer biology and can potentially lead to the discovery of novel drug targets.\n",
      "Question 16: What is the difference between pseudokinases and kinases?\n",
      "Response is: Pseudokinases and kinases are both types of proteins involved in regulating cellular processes. However, there is a key difference between them. Pseudokinases have a kinase-like domain but lack at least one of the conserved catalytic residues required for catalytic activity. As a result, pseudokinases are predicted to be inactive and unable to phosphorylate substrates. In contrast, kinases have an active kinase domain and are capable of catalyzing the covalent attachment of phosphate onto target proteins.\n",
      "Question 17: Which proteins have both kinase and pseudokinase domains?\n",
      "Response is: There is no information provided in the given context about any proteins that have both kinase and pseudokinase domains.\n",
      "Question 18: How many kinases and pseudokinases are encoded in human genome?\n",
      "Response is: The human genome encodes 518 protein kinases and 48 pseudokinases.\n",
      "Question 19: Which Receptor Protein Kinases have been classified as pseudokinases? \n",
      "Response is: The EGF receptor family member HER3, the ephrin receptors EphA10 and EphB6, and the orphan receptor CCK4 have been classified as pseudokinases.\n",
      "Question 20: List all known pseudokinases\n",
      "Response is: There are 48 known pseudokinases encoded by the human genome. These pseudokinases have been classified into seven groups (A to G) based on which of the three motifs in their pseudokinase domain they lack. The amino acid sequence and description of missing conserved residues for each pseudokinase can be found in a landmark study by Manning and colleagues.\n",
      "Question 21: Which SMARCA4 mutations rescue depletion or knockdown of SMARCA2?\n",
      "Response is: A few SMARCA4 mutations, specifically A1186T and R973L, have been found to rescue the growth defect observed after SMARCA2 depletion.\n",
      "Question 22: Which mutations are found in the Helicase domain of SMARCA4?\n",
      "Response is: The mutations found in the Helicase domain of SMARCA4 include hotspot missense mutations occurring within the ATP-binding cleft, DNA binding regions, and brace helices. These mutations are predicted to radically change the physiochemical properties of the residues, such as altering the charge, adding bulky side chains, or modifying polarity.\n",
      "Question 23: What is the effect of SMARCA4 mutations on overall survival of NSCLC patients?\n",
      "Response is: NSCLC patients with homozygous, truncating SMARCA4 mutations have significantly reduced overall survival compared to the wildtype SMARCA4 cohort.\n",
      "Question 24: What is the role of SMARCA2 and SMARCA4 in cancer?\n",
      "Response is: SMARCA2 and SMARCA4 are components of the mammalian switch/sucrose non-fermentable (mSWI/SNF or BAF) chromatin remodeling complex. In cancer, alterations in these components, including SMARCA4, have been frequently observed. Cells that have lost SMARCA4 rely on its paralog, SMARCA2, for their survival. This suggests that SMARCA2 could be a potential therapeutic target in cancer treatment. However, it is important to carefully select patients with inactivating, homozygous SMARCA4 missense mutations who may benefit from SMARCA2-targeted therapy.\n",
      "Question 25: Describe features of patient population in the paper\n",
      "Response is: The features of the patient population in the paper include the number of patients analyzed (131,668), the distribution of SMARCA4 mutation types (10,562 variants), and the zygosity of SMARCA4 truncating and nontruncating variants in a subset of patients (5699 patients). Additionally, the paper discusses the mutual exclusivity of SMARCA4 mutations with other BAF genes proﬁled in the FoundationOne® panel (ARID1A/B, ARID2, PBRM1, SMARCB1, SMARCD1).\n"

      "- The methodology involves using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing to systematically knockout genes in cancer cells and observe the effects on cell survival and proliferation.\n",
      "- This approach aims to uncover genes that are essential for cancer cell survival, providing potential targets for the development of new cancer drugs.\n",
      "Key distinctions between pseudokinases and kinases:\n",
      "\n",
      "Biological functions:\n",
      "- Kinases: catalyze the transfer of phosphate groups to target molecules, regulating various cellular processes.\n",
      "- Pseudokinases: lack catalytic activity, but can still play regulatory roles in signaling pathways.\n",
      "\n",
      "Structural characteristics:\n",
      "- Kinases: possess an intact active site with conserved catalytic residues.\n",
      "- Pseudokinases: harbor mutations in the active site, rendering them catalytically inactive.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, while kinases primarily function as catalysts in signaling cascades, pseudokinases exert their influence through non-catalytic mechanisms despite sharing structural similarities with kinases.\n",
      "- Proteins that possess both kinase and pseudokinase domains include JAK family of proteins, which are involved in cell signaling and have critical roles in the immune system and inflammatory responses.\n",
      "- The human genome encodes approximately 518 protein kinases and 48 pseudokinases.\n",
      "- Pseudokinases are receptor protein kinases that have been classified as inactive due to mutations in their kinase domain.\n",
      "- Examples of pseudokinases include HER3 (ErbB3), STK39 (NDR1/2), and KSR1/2.\n",
      "- The identified and studied pseudokinases in the field of biology and drug discovery include:\n",
      "  - Pseudokinase PDIK1L\n",
      "  - Pseudokinase Tribbles\n",
      "  - Pseudokinase STRAD\n",
      "  - Pseudokinase HER3/ErbB3\n",
      "- Investigating specific mutations in SMARCA4 that can compensate for the loss of SMARCA2\n",
      "- Interested in understanding the functional relationship between SMARCA4 and SMARCA2\n",
      "- This research could uncover potential targets for drug discovery in diseases related to these genes\n",
      "- Specific mutations identified in the Helicase domain of the SMARCA4 gene include missense mutations such as R1166C, R1166H, and R1181H.\n",
      "- These mutations are associated with cancer and are of particular interest for drug discovery efforts targeting SMARCA4-related malignancies.\n",
      "- Understanding the effects of these mutations on the function of the SMARCA4 gene can inform the development of targeted therapies for cancer treatment.\n",
      "- SMARCA4 mutations have a negative impact on the overall survival of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.\n",
      "- These mutations are associated with poor prognosis and reduced survival rates.\n",
      "- Understanding the specific effects of SMARCA4 mutations can inform targeted treatment strategies for NSCLC patients.\n",
      "- SMARCA2 and SMARCA4 are both members of the SWI/SNF family of chromatin remodeling complexes\n",
      "- They play important roles in gene regulation and chromatin remodeling \n",
      "- Mutations in SMARCA2 and SMARCA4 have been associated with various cancers, including lung, ovarian, and other solid tumors \n",
      "- Their dysregulation can contribute to tumorigenesis by affecting gene expression, cell proliferation, and DNA repair mechanisms \n",
      "- Targeted therapeutic interventions may involve developing drugs that specifically target the pathways and functions regulated by SMARCA2 and SMARCA4\n",
      "- The paper focuses on drug discovery and genomics in a specific disease or condition.\n",
      "- It explores the demographic and clinical characteristics of the patient population studied.\n",
      "- The information helps us understand how genetics and other factors influence drug response and treatment outcomes.\n"
