      "Question 1: Define synthetic lethality\n",
      "Response is: Synthetic lethality refers to a genetic phenomenon where the simultaneous mutation of two genes leads to cell death, while mutation of either gene alone is compatible with cell viability. In other words, the combination of mutations in both genes is lethal, but each individual mutation is not. This concept has been observed in various organisms, including humans, and has implications in cancer research and therapy. It suggests that targeting the products of genes that are synthetic lethal to cancer-causing mutations could selectively kill cancer cells while sparing normal cells.\n",
      "Question 2: Synthetic lethality was discovered in which model organism?\n",
      "Response is: Synthetic lethality was discovered in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster.\n",
      "Question 3: PARP gene expression shows synthetic lethal relationship with mutations in which genes?\n",
      "Response is: The context information does not provide specific information about which genes PARP gene expression shows a synthetic lethal relationship with mutations.\n",
      "Question 4: Synthetic lethality mechanims for BRAF gene can be harnessed in combination with which gene?\n",
      "Response is: PARP inhibitors can be harnessed in combination with the BRAF gene.\n",
      "Question 5: Names of tumor suppressor proteins\n",
      "Response is: pRB, p53, p73\n",
      "Question 6: Define synthetic lethality\n",
      "Response is: Synthetic lethality refers to a genetic phenomenon where the simultaneous mutation of two genes leads to cell death, while mutation of either gene alone is compatible with cell viability. In other words, the combination of mutations in both genes is lethal, but each individual mutation is not. This concept has been observed in various organisms, including humans, and has implications in cancer research and therapy. By identifying genes that are synthetic lethal to cancer-causing mutations, researchers can potentially develop targeted therapies that selectively kill cancer cells while sparing normal cells.\n",
      "Question 7: Which model organisms was synthetic lethality first observed in?\n",
      "Response is: Synthetic lethality was first observed in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster.\n",
      "Question 8: Which drugs target ERBB2 in breast cancer?\n",
      "Response is: Pertuzumab and trastuzumab are drugs that target ERBB2 in breast cancer.\n",
      "Question 9: KRAS oncogene is mutated in which cancers?\n",
      "Response is: KRAS oncogene is mutated in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and colorectal cancer.\n",
      "Question 10: Which compounds are selectively lethal to MSH2 deficient cells?\n",
      "Response is: Methotrexate is one of the compounds that are selectively lethal to MSH2 deficient cells.\n",
      "Question 11: Which genes are targeted by Imatinib?\n",
      "Response is: Imatinib targets the kit receptor tyrosine kinase.\n",
      "Question 12: Which drugs target BRAF mutations?\n",
      "Response is: Dabrafenib, encorafenib, vemurafenib, and trametinib are drugs that target BRAF mutations.\n",
      "Question 13: Deletion of which gene leads to synthetic lethal inhibition of PRMT5?\n",
      "Response is: MTAP\n",
      "Question 14: Which gene is synthetic lethal partner of ARID1A?\n",
      "Response is: The synthetic lethal partner of ARID1A is not mentioned in the given context information.\n",
      "Question 15: What is Project Achilles?\n",
      "Response is: Project Achilles is a functional genomic screening initiative led by the Broad Institute. Its goal is to create a genome-wide catalogue of tumor vulnerabilities associated with genetic and epigenetic alterations. The project utilizes short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screening and CRISPR-based screening to interrogate gene essentiality in cancer cell lines. The data obtained from Project Achilles are valuable for understanding cancer biology and can potentially lead to the discovery of novel drug targets.\n",
      "Question 16: What is the difference between pseudokinases and kinases?\n",
      "Response is: Pseudokinases and kinases are both types of proteins involved in regulating cellular processes. However, there is a key difference between them. Pseudokinases have a kinase-like domain but lack at least one of the conserved catalytic residues required for catalytic activity. As a result, pseudokinases are predicted to be inactive and unable to phosphorylate substrates. In contrast, kinases have an active kinase domain and are capable of catalyzing the covalent attachment of phosphate onto target proteins.\n",
      "Question 17: Which proteins have both kinase and pseudokinase domains?\n",
      "Response is: There is no information provided in the given context about any proteins that have both kinase and pseudokinase domains.\n",
      "Question 18: How many kinases and pseudokinases are encoded in human genome?\n",
      "Response is: The human genome encodes 518 protein kinases and 48 pseudokinases.\n",
      "Question 19: Which Receptor Protein Kinases have been classified as pseudokinases? \n",
      "Response is: The EGF receptor family member HER3, the ephrin receptors EphA10 and EphB6, and the orphan receptor CCK4 have been classified as pseudokinases.\n",
      "Question 20: List all known pseudokinases\n",
      "Response is: There are 48 known pseudokinases encoded by the human genome. These pseudokinases have been classified into seven groups (A to G) based on which of the three motifs in their pseudokinase domain they lack. The amino acid sequence and description of missing conserved residues for each pseudokinase can be found in a landmark study by Manning and colleagues.\n",
      "Question 21: Which SMARCA4 mutations rescue depletion or knockdown of SMARCA2?\n",
      "Response is: A few SMARCA4 mutations, specifically A1186T and R973L, have been found to rescue the growth defect observed after SMARCA2 depletion.\n",
      "Question 22: Which mutations are found in the Helicase domain of SMARCA4?\n",
      "Response is: The mutations found in the Helicase domain of SMARCA4 include hotspot missense mutations occurring within the ATP-binding cleft, DNA binding regions, and brace helices. These mutations are predicted to radically change the physiochemical properties of the residues, such as altering the charge, adding bulky side chains, or modifying polarity.\n",
      "Question 23: What is the effect of SMARCA4 mutations on overall survival of NSCLC patients?\n",
      "Response is: NSCLC patients with homozygous, truncating SMARCA4 mutations have significantly reduced overall survival compared to the wildtype SMARCA4 cohort.\n",
      "Question 24: What is the role of SMARCA2 and SMARCA4 in cancer?\n",
      "Response is: SMARCA2 and SMARCA4 are components of the mammalian switch/sucrose non-fermentable (mSWI/SNF or BAF) chromatin remodeling complex. In cancer, alterations in these components, including SMARCA4, have been frequently observed. Cells that have lost SMARCA4 rely on its paralog, SMARCA2, for their survival. This suggests that SMARCA2 could be a potential therapeutic target in cancer treatment. However, it is important to carefully select patients with inactivating, homozygous SMARCA4 missense mutations who may benefit from SMARCA2-targeted therapy.\n",
      "Question 25: Describe features of patient population in the paper\n",
      "Response is: The features of the patient population in the paper include the number of patients analyzed (131,668), the distribution of SMARCA4 mutation types (10,562 variants), and the zygosity of SMARCA4 truncating and nontruncating variants in a subset of patients (5699 patients). Additionally, the paper discusses the mutual exclusivity of SMARCA4 mutations with other BAF genes proﬁled in the FoundationOne® panel (ARID1A/B, ARID2, PBRM1, SMARCB1, SMARCD1).\n"
