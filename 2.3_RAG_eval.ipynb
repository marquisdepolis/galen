      "Rewritten question is: The impact of SMARCA4 mutations on the overall survival of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients has been studied extensively in recent years due to its potential role as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target. However, the results have been somewhat inconclusive, likely due to the heterogeneity of patient populations, treatment regimens, and study designs across different research efforts.\n",

      "Some studies have suggested that SMARCA4 mutations may be associated with poor outcomes in NSCLC, particularly when combined with other genetic alterations such as STK11 or KEAP1 mutations.

      "- Largescale synthetic lethal genetic interaction screens have been carried out in budding yeast or fission yeast due to availability of high-throughput technologies\n",
      "- Advances in RNA interference and CRISPR technology now enable largescale unbiased synthetic lethality screening directly in human cell culture\n",
      "- The application of synthetic lethality using yeast genetic screens has been proposed to identify vulnerabilities in cancer cells based on defined genetic defects\n",
      "- The study identified 10,562 SMARCA4 variants, including 6,289 missense mutations, by sequencing tumors from 131,668 patients.\n",
      "- Hotspot missense mutations occurred within the ATP-binding cleft, DNA binding regions, and brace helices.\n",
      "- Frequently mutated residues lie within highly conserved regions of SMARCA4, including certain residues within the ATP binding pocket.\n",
      "- SMARCA4 missense mutants have reduced remodeling activity.\n",
      "- SMARCA4 R1135 and R1157 are similarly mutated at equivalent sites in other SNF2 family helicases, indicating potential functional importance.\n",
      "- Many mutations are predicted to radically change the physiochemical properties of these residues.\n",
      "- Enrichment of SMARCA2 binding was observed in certain regions, indicating their potential functional importance.\n",
      "- Pseudokinases are scattered throughout different protein kinase subfamilies, suggesting diverse evolutionary origins\n",
      "- 28 pseudokinases have homologues across various species lacking equivalent catalytic residues\n",
      "- Human pseudokinases are classified into seven groups (A to G) based on the motifs in their pseudokinase domain that they lack\n",
      "- Some pseudokinase domains are part of larger multidomain proteins and likely have independent functions\n",
      "- Some kinases, like WNK1, without essential catalytic residues can still be active\n",
      "- Pseudokinases, despite being inactive in phosphorylating substrates, play pivotal roles in regulating cellular processes\n",
      "- Examples include the pseudokinase STRAD controlling the tumor suppressor kinase LKB1 and the tyrosine kinase JAK2\n",
      "- Pseudokinases are found throughout distinct protein kinase subfamilies and have evolved from diverse active kinases\n",
      "- Human pseudokinases are classified into seven groups (A to G) based on the motifs in their pseudokinase domain\n",
      "- A comparison of the domain structures of all human pseudokinases is shown in Figure 2\n",
      "- Several pseudokinases form complexes with active protein kinases, possibly contributing to any measured activity\n",
      "- Pseudokinases similar to receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) include HER3, EphA10, EphB6, and CCK4\n",
      "- Pseudokinase abbreviations include ANP, CAK1, CASK, CYGF, Drl, Eph, ErbB, MLKL, NRBP, and others\n",
      "- Mutant SMARCA4 (A1186T and R973L) rescued growth defects observed after SMARCA2 depletion despite negligible chromatin remodeling activity.\n",
      "- The rescue effects seen with SMARCA4 mutants were validated with CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of SMARCA2.\n",
      "- ATAC-seq showed a marked decrease in chromatin accessibility after SMARCA2 depletion, which was completely rescued with SMARCA4 WT.\n",
      "- The decrease in accessibility after SMARCA2 knockdown was strongest in the LACZ control relative to the LOF mutant lines.\n",
      "- SMARCA4 missense mutants were unable to fully rescue SMARCA2 knockdown, confirming their loss-of-function status.\n",
      "- SMARCA4 mutants (K785R, E882K, T910M, R1135W, G1162C, R1192C, G1232S) are confirmed to be loss-of-function.\n"
