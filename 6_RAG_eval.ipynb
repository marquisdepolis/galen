      "Synthetic lethality can result from the interaction between pseudokinases and oncogenes. Pseudokinases are a type of protein that resemble kinases but lack the ability to catalyze phosphorylation reactions. In the context of cancer, pseudokinases can interact with oncogenes to create a synthetic lethal relationship. This means that the presence of mutations in both the pseudokinase and the oncogene is lethal to the cancer cells, while mutations in either one alone are compatible with cell viability. This interaction can be exploited for therapeutic purposes, as targeting the pseudokinase or the oncogene alone may not be effective, but targeting both can selectively kill cancer cells.\n"

recently approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma31 Discovery of human synthetic lethal interactions Our knowledge of the molecular networks that are established in normal cells and cancer cells is too rudimentary to allow reliable predictions of the genes that will be synthetic lethal to a given cancer gene Nonetheless a few ideas have been put forward for how synthetic lethal combinations might be achieved based on first principles Many oncoproteins includ ing E2F1 and MYC represent a doubleedged sword for cancer cells because they deliver both promitogenic and proapoptotic signals A counter intuitive approach to treating cancer cells that have hyperactive oncoproteins such as these would be treat ing them with drugs that enhance their action further in the hope of crossing an apoptotic threshold For example E2F1 is negatively regulated by both pRB and cyclin A3235 Loss of the pRB pathway establishes a positivefeedback loop in which E2F1 activates its own promoter36 and blocking the remaining interaction of cyclin A with E2F1 kills transformed cells but not their normal counterparts3739 Unfortunately inhibiting the activity of the cyclinA partner CDK2 cyclindepend ent kinase 2 does not have the same effect40 possibly because another catalytic partner can substitute for CDK2 in its absence4142 Synthetic lethal interactions might also be predicted based on the
